		<h1>NYC Transit Time Map: how does it work?</h1>
		<section>
			<p>
				My favorite thing about the NYC subway map is how it's not geographically accurate—it disorts the sizes and shapes of boroughs to make the map easier to read. I thought it might be fun to make a subway map that distorts geography an a different way: based on travel times between stops.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the data that went into the map comes from <a href='http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html'>the MTA's GTFS feed</a>, which provides information about routes, stops and schedules.
			</p>
			<p>
				The map is rendered using <a href='https://d3js.org'>D3</a> — initially, acccording to the latitude and longitude of each stop. But when you click a stop, a simulation is run to calculate the travel time from that stop to every other stop. Using train departure times from the MTA, and the MTA's predicted <em>transfer times</em> within stations, the code counts how many minutes it takes for a simulated passenger departing the selected stop at 8:00 on a weekday would arrive at each stop on the map. [You can see the code for this on Github — the simulation is done in <a href='https://github.com/nate-parrott/subway/blob/master/virtual_rider.js'>virtual_rider.js</a>].
			</p>
			<p>
				Once travel times are computed, positioning each stop is done by measuring the geographic angle from the selected stop to each other stop, but adjusting the <em>distance</em> from the selected stop so that it's proportional to travel time.
